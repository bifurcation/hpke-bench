Benchmarking HPKE with SHA-3
============================

This repository contains a small reference implementation of HPKE, structured to
allow us to measure the performance impact of changes to HPKE.  Specifically,
proposed mechanisms to integrate SHA3 / SHAKE / XOFs in the "KDF" slot, as
[discussed] on the HPKE mailing list.

The core change involved is in the `KeySchedule` function, and in particular,
the way that the `key`, `base_nonce`, and `exporter_secret` values are derived
from the inputs.  In this experiment, we compare three variations:

* Integrating SHA-3 via HPKE (as [suggested by Dierdre])
* An XOF-based approach with derivation labels (as [suggested by Sophie])
* An XOF-based approach with length-separated outputs (my own invention)

These are benchmarked separately and in the context of HPKE.  For the latter
measurement, we use DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) as the KEM, because this is
empirically the fastest of the registered KEMs, and thus will show any key
schedule differences to their greatest advantage.  Also looked at ML-KEM-768
because [Dierdre asked].

# Local Measurement Results

```
> cargo bench
```

Environment:

* MacBook M1 Pro, vintage 2021
* Rust 1.85.1
* Rust Crypto and X25519-Dalek used for underlying primitives
* Weather: 25C and cloudy
* Moon phase: Waning crescent, 7% illumination

Measurements reflect the mean value measured by Criterion.
